# Aider Code Review Findings

## Critical Issues

1. **Package Management Configuration**
   - Missing `pyproject.toml` - this is particularly important for modern Python packaging
   - Need to add proper support for uv package installer alongside pip
   - Should consider adding explicit dependency specifications

2. **Installation Process**
   - Current installation documentation in README.md suggests using pip: `python -m pip install aider-install`
   - Should be updated to include uv installation instructions
   - Development installation process needs documentation

## Model Configuration

1. **Default Model Settings**
   - Default model name set to "gpt-4o" in models.py
   - Comprehensive list of OpenAI models supported
   - Consider adding validation for model availability when using different installers

## Setup and Environment

1. **Environment Loading**
   - Environment variables loaded through dotenv feature
   - SSL verification can be disabled (potential security consideration)
   - Multiple configuration file locations supported

## Recommendations

1. **Package Configuration Updates**
   - Add `pyproject.toml` with following sections:
     - build-system requirements
     - project metadata
     - dependencies
     - development dependencies
     - uv-specific configurations

2. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update installation instructions to include uv
   - Add development setup section
   - Document configuration file precedence

3. **Testing Considerations**
   - Ensure test suite covers both pip and uv installation methods
   - Add specific tests for package dependency resolution

## Next Steps

1. Create `pyproject.toml` with proper configuration
2. Update installation documentation
3. Add uv-specific handling in package management code
4. Review and update test suite for package management
